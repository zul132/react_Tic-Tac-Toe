# Tic-Tac-Toe Game using React
This is a simple tic-tac-toe that:
- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores and displays a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

### Inspiration
I am (or rather was) a beginner to react. I decided to build this game as a mini-project in order to learn the basics of react and get an intuition as to how an actual react application is built.

### Resources
I primarily used the React Learn tutorial on react.dev, the official website for react.js.
